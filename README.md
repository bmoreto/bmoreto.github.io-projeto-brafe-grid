# ☕ Brafé Project (Custom Grid System)

A responsive website developed during the **Advanced CSS – Positioning Course** by [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/).  
This version of the **Brafé** project was built using a **custom CSS Grid system**, created manually from scratch to better understand how grid-based layouts work behind the scenes.

## 🚀 About the Course

The **Advanced CSS – Positioning Course** focuses on deepening the understanding of how CSS properties affect layout behavior.  
In this specific project, the goal was to create a **custom grid system**, similar to those used by frameworks like Bootstrap — but built entirely with **pure CSS** to gain full control over columns, rows, and spacing.

The project demonstrates how defining your own grid architecture provides flexibility, scalability, and a better understanding of layout composition.
